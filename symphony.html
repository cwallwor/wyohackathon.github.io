        <h3>SYMPHONY OF BLOCKCHAIN EXHIBITION</h3>
        <p>SEPTEMBER 19—22, 2019</p>
        <p class="pr-lg-4 mt-3">
The Symphony of Blockchain is an interactive, visual and auditory exploration of Bitcoin,
cryptocurrency and the blockchain brought to you by our sponsor IOHK. It is an ongoing
research initiative with a singular aim: to help bring about greater understanding of both
blockchain technology and the ever expanding (and contracting) cryptocurrency marketplace.
Symphony also explores the blockchain as an auditory experience. We ask a simple question;
‘What does the blockchain sound like?’ Using the frequency and timing of bitcoin transactions
as a foundation, the audio extends the crystallizing structures by encoding as an sound based
entity.</p><p>
The background sound is an ambient soundscape created from real recordings of computer
power supplies and fans to emulate the sound of bitcoin mining. The intensity of the sound
varies with the hashrate of the network.</p><p>
Once the Blockchain is loaded users simple scroll up or down to move forward or back in time
through the blockchain. Using their pointer (or finger on mobile) they can simply select an
individual node or block in the chain to investigate it further. Once accessed the user is
presented with a view of the unique Merkle tree that identifies that specific block. In addition
to the Markle tree view the user is presented with a plethora of information regarding the
detail around the transaction the selected block represents.
